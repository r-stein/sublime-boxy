> Boxy has been recently re-named from Otto. The website and package is still being updated. If you're new to Boxy, you should install the **`Boxy Theme`** package on [Package Control][downloads] when it [will be available][pr] or install it [manually][manual-install]. 

> For those who updating read [Upgrading From 1.x.x][upgrading]. 

> I highly recommend you:

> 1. Install `BOXY` [manually][manual-install] before it will be released
> 2. Review your [settings][settings]
> 3. Install or Upgrade via Package Control when 2.0.0 [will be available][pr].

> Docs for 1.x.x can be found [here][docs1xx].
